# Game-2048 Logic Implementation

## Overview
This project focuses on the core logic of a game inspired by 2048, where players combine tiles to achieve higher scores. I built the game logic, which is represented in the following four methods:

- `tilt(Side side)`: Handles the movement and merging of tiles on the board.
- `emptySpaceExists(Board b)`: Checks for any empty spaces on the board.
- `maxTileExists(Board b)`: Determines if the maximum tile has been achieved.
- `atLeastOneMoveExists(Board b)`: Checks if there are any valid moves left.
